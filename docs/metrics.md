# What each figure means

Every figure is computed in `packages/core` from crawled pull requests and deploy workflow runs. The reasoning behind each rule is in ADR 0006; this page is the reader's version. Times are UTC and weeks start on Monday. The current, unfinished week is left off weekly charts so a part week does not look like a slump.

## Flow

| Figure                 | From                                             | To                                            | Notes                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Coding time            | First commit (earlier of authored and committed) | PR opened                                     | A rebased first commit dated after the PR opened counts as zero.                                                               |
| Time to first review   | PR ready for review                              | First review by someone other than the author | Draft time is excluded. The author commenting on their own PR is not a review.                                                 |
| Time to approval       | PR ready for review                              | First approval by someone else                |                                                                                                                                |
| Open to merge          | PR opened                                        | Merged                                        | Also split into reviewed and unreviewed PRs, because a solo author waits for nobody.                                           |
| Cycle time             | First commit                                     | Merged                                        | Shown as four stages: coding, waiting for review, in review, to merge. The stacked chart uses means because only means add up. |
| Size                   |                                                  |                                               | Additions plus deletions. Includes lockfiles, generated and vendored code, so read it as batch size, not output.               |
| Merged per author-week |                                                  |                                               | PRs merged divided by the sum, over weeks, of people who opened or merged a PR that week.                                      |

Every summary shows the median and the 75th percentile. Bots (`dependabot`, `renovate`, any `[bot]` or GitHub `Bot` account) are excluded unless you include them.

## DORA

A **deployment** is a completed run, succeeded or failed, of the workflow files you configured for a repository, on its deploy branch. Cancelled and skipped runs are ignored.

| Measure               | Rule                                                                                     | Elite         | High         | Medium            | Low    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ------ |
| Deployment frequency  | Successful deploys per week over the range                                               | 7 or more     | 1 or more    | 1 a month or more | less   |
| Lead time for changes | First commit to the end of the first successful deploy starting after the merge (median) | under a day   | under a week | under a month     | longer |
| Change failure rate   | Failed deploys over all counted deploys                                                  | 5% or less    | 10% or less  | 15% or less       | more   |
| Time to restore       | First failure in a streak to the next success (median)                                   | under an hour | under a day  | under a week      | longer |

Lead time only counts PRs merged after the first deploy run the crawl has seen (ADR 0007). Without that rule, a repository whose pipeline is younger than its history reports months of lead time that never happened.

PRs titled `revert` or `hotfix` are counted beside the change failure rate rather than inside it.

## Comparing repositories fairly

- **Align to project start** puts week N of each project on one axis.
- **Per contributor** divides weekly throughput by the people active that week.
- **Period all were active** compares the same calendar weeks, from the latest project start to today.
- **Show people** reveals per-person figures and is off by default (ADR 0008).
